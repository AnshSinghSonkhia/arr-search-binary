Here are the key functions we should include in `arr-search-binary` to cover all types of binary search problems:

### **Basic Search**
1. **`binarySearch(arr, target)`** – Standard binary search for finding an element in a sorted array.

### **Variations on Sorted Arrays**
2. **`firstOccurrence(arr, target)`** – Finds the first occurrence of the target element.
3. **`lastOccurrence(arr, target)`** – Finds the last occurrence of the target element.
4. **`countOccurrences(arr, target)`** – Returns the count of occurrences of the target element.
5. **`floorValue(arr, target)`** – Finds the greatest element smaller than or equal to the target.
6. **`ceilValue(arr, target)`** – Finds the smallest element greater than or equal to the target.

### **Searching in Rotated Sorted Arrays**
7. **`searchInRotatedSortedArray(arr, target)`** – Searches for an element in a rotated sorted array.
8. **`findRotationIndex(arr)`** – Finds the index where the sorted array was rotated.
9. **`minInRotatedSortedArray(arr)`** – Finds the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.
10. **`maxInRotatedSortedArray(arr)`** – Finds the maximum element in a rotated sorted array.

### **Range-Based Binary Search**
11. **`findPeakElement(arr)`** – Finds a peak element in an array where an element is greater than its neighbors.
12. **`findMountainPeak(arr)`** – Finds the peak in a mountain array (bitonic array).
13. **`searchInMountainArray(arr, target)`** – Searches for an element in a mountain array.

### **Binary Search on Answers**
14. **`squareRoot(n, precision)`** – Finds the square root of a number using binary search.
15. **`nthRoot(n, k, precision)`** – Finds the nth root of a number using binary search.
16. **`minInSortedRotatedDuplicates(arr)`** – Finds the minimum in a sorted, rotated array with duplicates.
